# Vietnam Draft Lottery 

A [famous paper](http://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2011/06/Angrist_lifetime-earningsmall.pdf) by Angrist exploits the randomized lottery for the Vietnam draft to estimate the effect of education on wages. (*Don’t worry about reading this article, it is just provided to satisfy your curiosity; you can answer the question below without referring to it. In fact, it may be easier for you not to, since he has some complications to deal with that the simple data we’re giving you do not.*)

## Problem Setup

Angrist’s idea is this: During the Vietnam era, draft numbers were determined randomly by birth date -- the army would literally randomly draw birthdays out of a hat, and those whose birthdays came up sooner were higher up on the list to be drafted first. For example, all young American men born on May 2 of a given year might have draft number 1 and be the first to be called up for service, followed by November 13 who would get draft number 2 and be second, etc. The higher-ranked (closer to 1) your draft number, the likelier it was you would be drafted.

We have generated a fake version of this data for your use in this project. You can find real information [here](https://www.sss.gov/About/History-And-Records/lotter1). While we're defining having a high draft number as falling at 80, in reality in 1970 any number lower than 195 would have been a "high" draft number, in 1971 anything lower than 125 would have been "high". 

High draft rank induced many Americans to go to college, because being a college student was an excuse to avoid the draft -- so those with higher-ranked draft numbers attempted to enroll in college for fear of being drafted, whereas those with lower-ranked draft numbers felt less pressure to enroll in college just to avoid the draft (some still attended college regardless, of course). Draft numbers therefore cause a natural experiment in education, as we now have two randomly assigned groups, with one group having higher mean levels of education, those with higher draft numbers, than another, those with lower draft numbers. (In the language of econometricians, we say the draft number is “an instrument for education,” or that draft number is an “instrumental variable.”)

Some simplifying assumptions:

- Suppose that these data are a true random sample of IRS records and that these records measure every living American’s income without error.
- Suppose that this data is the result of the following SQL query (this information is informative for the differential attrition question): 

```{SQL} 
SELECT 
  ssearning AS earnings 
    years_of_schooling AS years_education
    ein AS id
FROM irs_income_1980 
JOIN draft_status 
ON ssearning.id = draft_status.id
DROP id 

```

- Assume that the true effect of education on income is linear in the number of years of education obtained.
- Assume all the data points are from Americans born in a single year and we do not need to worry about cohort effects of any kind.


```{r load draft data}
d <- fread('./draft_data.csv')

head(d)
```

## Questions to Answer

1. Suppose that you had not run an experiment. Estimate the "effect" of each year of education on income as an observational researcher might, by just running a regression of years of education on income (in R-ish, `income ~ years_education`). What does this naive regression suggest?

```{r observational model} 
model_observational <- lm(income~years_education,data=d)
summary(model_observational)
```
**Answer: It suggests each year of additioal education will result in an additional 5750 dollar in additional income**

2. Continue to suppose that we did not run the experiment, but that we saw the result that you noted in part 1. Tell a concrete story about why you don't believe that observational result tells you anything causal. 

>**Answer: There might be ommited variabels such as age, intellectual capabilit, and experience, that are correlated with education and income. Therefore, we could over estimated the relatioship between education and income.**

3. Now, let’s get to using the natural experiment. Define "having a high-ranked draft number" as having a draft number between 1-80. For the remaining 285 days of the year, consider them having a "low-ranked" draft number). Create a variable in your dataset called `high_draft` that indicates whether each person has a high-ranked draft number or not. Using a regression, estimate the effect of having a high-ranked draft number on years of education obtained. Report the estimate and a correctly computed standard error. (*Hint: How is the assignment to having a draft number conducted? Does random assignment happen at the individual level? Or, at some higher level?)

```{r draft effect on education}
library(lmtest)
d[, high_draft := ifelse(draft_number <= 80, 1, 0)]
model_education <- d[, lm(years_education ~ high_draft)]
coeftest(model_education, .vcov = vcovHC(model_education))

```
**Answer: Because the randomization is based on draft_number, this is highly clustered.The regression results tells us  the high-ranked group people have on average around 2.126 years of additional education with a standard error of 0.0379 years. It's highly statistically significant.**

4. Using linear regression, estimate the effect of having a high-ranked draft number on income. Report the estimate and the correct standard error.

```{r draft effect on income} 
model_income <- d[, lm(income ~ high_draft)]
coeftest(model_income, .vcov = vcovHC(model_income))

```
**Answer: People in high ranked group earns on average additional 6637 dollars with a standard error of 528.**

5. Now, estimate the Instrumental Variables regression to estimate the effect of education on income. To do so, use `AER::ivreg`. After you evaluate your code, write a narrative description about what you learn. 

```{r instrumental variables regression} 
library('ivreg')
model_iv <-ivreg(income ~ years_education|high_draft, data = d)
model_iv

```
**Answer: What I learnt is the income depends on both education level and whether they are high ranked**
6. Just like the other experiments that we've covered in the course, natural experiments rely crucially on satisfying the "exclusion restriction". 

In the case of a medical trial, we've said this means that there can't be an effect of just "being at the doctor's office" when the doctor is giving you a treatment. In the case of an instrumental variable's setup, the *instrument* (being drafted) cannot affect the outcome (income) in any other way except through its effect on the "endogenous variable" (here, education).

Give one reason this requirement might not be satisfied in this context. In what ways might having a high draft rank affect individuals' income **other** than nudging them to attend more school? 

> **Answer: People who are drafted gained experience during the war, such as operating guns or machines, which lead to higher income without attending more school.**

7. Conduct a test for the presence of differential attrition by treatment condition. That is, conduct a formal test of the hypothesis that the “high-ranked draft number” treatment has no effect on whether we observe a person’s income. **(Note, that an earning of $0 *actually* means they didn't earn any money -- i.e. earning $0 does not mean that their data wasn't measured.)**

```{r differential attrition}
model_differential_attrition <- d[, .(n = .N), keyby= .(draft_number, high_draft)]
model_differential_attrition[, t.test(n ~ high_draft)]

```
**Answer: The P-value suggests it is highly statistically significant. We reject the null hypothesis that high ranked draft number has no effect on people's income**
8. Tell a concrete story about what could be leading to the result in part 7. How might this differential attrition create bias in the estimates of a causal effect?

> **Answer: There could be some survivor bias. High ranked people may have higher possibility of dieing during the war. We could have missed the cases that they died and did not report their income.**
